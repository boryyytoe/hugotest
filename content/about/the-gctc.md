## Learn about the Global City Teams Challenge


Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) involve connecting smart devices and systems—in diverse sectors such as transportation, energy, manufacturing, and healthcare—in fundamentally new ways. These technologies will enable cities and communities to improve services, promote economic growth, and enhance the quality of life.

Because many of today’s smart city/community development efforts are isolated and customized projects, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) launched the Global City Teams Challenge (GCTC) to encourage collaboration and the development of standards. GCTC’s long-term goal is “to establish and demonstrate replicable, scalable, and sustainable models for incubation and deployment of interoperable, standard-based solutions using advanced technologies such as IoT and CPS, and demonstrate their measurable benefits in communities and cities.” To put it simply, this program will help communities benefit from the experience of others to improve efficiency and lower costs.

NIST, along with its partners, acts as a matchmaker and incubator —facilitating, advising, encouraging, nurturing, and publicizing the action clusters and their projects. Since the programs launched in September 2014, GCTC has recruited and incubated over 160 with participation from over 150 cities and 400 companies/organizations from around the world.
