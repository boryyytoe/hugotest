A SuperCluster is a multi-city, multi-stakeholder collaboration organized around common project objectives and shared solutions. Committed cities/communities and partners jointly tackle shared issues â€“ develop and deploy shares solutions to create economies of scale. Each SuperCluster produces blueprint/playbook to be used by cities and communities around the world as the foundation to build their own smart city strategies. A SuperCluster is an alliance of action clusters in the same sector, and may be joined by individual entities that do not belong to a specific action cluster.

## Transportation SuperCluster (TSC)

This supercluster was formed and is managed by forward looking municipalities interested in preparing their infrastructure for new technologies that look set to provide better, more equitable services at lower cost. It explores the opportunities provided by first and last mile vehicles including shared, low speed and autonomous. It explores the opportunities for building vibrant communities around transfer points and mobility hubs and it addresses how these vehicles and hubs can play a role in the last mile delivery of packages and other freight. To support these opportunities the supercluster works with teams developing new and advanced transportation models and environmental sensors that allow both the prediction of probable outcomes and the measurement of actual outcomes of introducing these technologies. Finally the supercluster works with teams implementing a smart citySDK to ensure the portability and interchangeability of solutions and propose regulatory and policy changes that support the safe deployment of these technologies.

## City Platform/Dashboard SuperCluster (CPSC)

The cities of Kansas City, Missouri and Bellevue, Washington are teaming with 20 other cities and several corporate partners including Cisco and XAQT to lead the GCTC City Platform Supercluster. We believe that the heart of a Smart City is data. We believe that technology can make a city cool, but data (its collection, analysis and integration into a decision support platform) makes it smart.  We are seeking to discover the common set of things we all measure and understand how we can standardize that list. By agreeing on what we measure, all cities can then apply the data in a manner that allows each of us to address our unique challenges regardless of the size, governance or location of our municipality.

## Public Safety SuperCluster (PSSC)

The Public Safety SuperCluster (PSSC) of the US Ignite-sponsored Global City Teams Challenge is a public-private partnership dedicated to identifying technologies, processes and strategies from among GCTC members to enhance public safety and resilience within smart connected communities, and improve the preparedness, response and recovery of modern society from the complex challenges, hazards and risks that threaten local and regional stability. The broad goal of the PSSC is to develop, integrate and pilot technology applications and test new operating procedures and employment methods in collaboration with first responders, public safety officials, and government agencies, to improve situational awareness before, during, and after an incident or civil emergency in order to protect human life, maintain community functions and infrastructure, and ensure public safety.  Moreover, the PSSC aims to improve policies and procedures for integration of advanced communications methods and decision systems to enhance interagency planning and coordination of resources within smart and connected communities. The PSSC focuses specific attention on the integration of current and future Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to build resilience and sustainability into the technology ecosystem that comprises smart, connected communities.  The PSSC was launched in 2016 by GCTC member communities engaged in developing public-safety focused technologies, and is currently open to membership by all communities, private sector enterprises, non-governmental organizations, and government agencies (at all levels), who share an interest in addressing current and future challenges in public safety, disaster preparedness, and community resilience through the development and integration of advanced technologies.

## Energy/Water/Waste Management SuperCluster (EWSC)

The GCTC Utility SuperCluster purpose is to address leading sustainability issues in cities for Energy, Water and Waste by bringing cities and counties together in the United States and around the world with academia and technology partners to demonstrate real world class examples and best practices. The SuperCluster is managed in three groups with each group managed with its own working group chair. Each Energy, Water and Waste working group is responsible for managing active projects with a common goal to develop a common blueprint.  The blueprint will represent best practices and serve as a practical guide for the implementation IoT technologies/

Objectives for the Utility SuperCluster include:

* Reduce water lost through leaks in water transmission and distribution utility infrastructure

* Increase water revenues with new and innovative metering technologies

* Increase water conservation adoption with weather analytics bases solutions

* Address city resilience needs with a focus on energy

* Develop and implement new strategies for zero waste

* Make it easy for cities to have access to public private partners funding models and government grant information

## Public WiFi SuperCluster (PWSC)

The GCTC Public Wi-Fi SuperCluster is focused on development of best practices for the deployment of high-speed, public Wi-Fi systems. As wireless internet connectivity has grown to become a critical part of our society, municipalities have discovered that wireless service in public spaces can be more than just a nice amenity; it can be a tool for economic development, a lever for tackling the digital divide and homework gap, and serve as core infrastructure in IoT networks, supporting smart city applications such as public safety, energy, lighting, transportation, and more.

Yet, for all of its promise, the goals of deploying ubiquitous, public Wi-Fi connectivity and the building and sustaining a municipally-owned wireless system remain difficult to achieve. As a result, many municipalities have struggled to deploy and sustain these systems. The Public Wi-Fi SuperCluster will address these issues by analysis aimed at uncovering the best practices for successful deployments from municipalities themselves. These best practices will come in the form of interviews, workshops, and case studies covering four broad areas: technical design; financial, legal, and marketing; project management; and outcomes & use cases.

By collecting, analyzing, and reporting this information in aggregate, the Public Wi-Fi SuperCluster aims to publish a blueprint for municipalities of any kind - whether large or small, urban or rural - to successfully deploy public Wi-Fi by learning from those who have done it already.
